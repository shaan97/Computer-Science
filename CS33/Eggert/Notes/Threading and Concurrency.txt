Threading and Concurrency
	3 Major Ways to Control Concurrency
		- Processes (different virtual machines, independent)
		- Multiplexing (single core / single CPU)
		- Multithreading (multiple cores, single virtual machine)

	Why this Concurrency?
		- Computation is N times faster, where N is the number of cores
		- Access slow devices (including us!)
		- defer work while busy (e.g. garbage collection while burst of requests)
		- fair access from multiple clients (often competing with computation speed)
