A. The conditional test always succeeds because sizeof(int) returns a size_t, which is unsigned. This causes the integer maxbytes to be cast into an unsigned
integer. As a result, the difference between an unsigned integer and unsigned size_t will always be greater than or equal to 0, making the conditional statement always true.

B. /* Copy integer into buffer if space is available */
   /* WARNING: The following code is buggy */
   void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
      if ( maxbytes >= 0 && maxbytes >= sizeof(int) )
         memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
   }
