1.)
Brady's patch involved removing a goto statment that would
basically jump the line of execution to the case block of
code specified as "case_long_iso_time_style". Since having
a specifier for that block of code was unnecessary, Brady
decided to remove the specifier. The code would
compile and execute the same regardless (since nowhere else 
is a "goto case_long_iso_time_style" presumably used, as 
removing it does indeed compile successfully). Brady
likely removed it because since it was now unnecessary,
it would keep the code clean.

2.)
If my company adopted this patch, we would be concerned
about our clients in non-English speaking areas. The format
in India for instance is DAY MONTH YEAR, which could be
a source of confusion when looking at the MONTH DAY
YEAR format. Additionally in other countries they may not
be used to our names for months ("January" vs. "Enero" in
Spanish). 

3.)
Because /dev/null is an empty file, the line of python code

self.lines = f.readlines()

ends up making lines an empty list. Due to this, invoking
the member function chooseline(...) in turn invokes
random.choice(self.lines). In the source code of random,
there is a comment specifying that random.choice(...)
raises an IndexError exception in the case that the given
list is empty. Thus, IndexError is "raised," and execution
halts.

4.)
Using Python 3 results in a compile error, since this code
is not portable from Python 2 to Python 3. In particular,
the syntax

"except IOError as (errno, strerror):"
		   ^
is not valid Python 3.
