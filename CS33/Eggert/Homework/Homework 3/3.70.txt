A.

e1.p		0 byte offset
e1.y		8 byte offset
e2.x		0 byte offset
e2.next		8 byte offset

B.
The entire union takes 8 bytes, since both member variables take up 8 bytes total,
and the unions size is the maximum size of its member variables.

C.
void proc (union ele *up){
	up->e2.x = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up->e2.next->e1.y;
}
