Algorithm
	A step by step description of to acomplish a task

Compiler
	A program that translates a computer program in a high level language (like Java) to a lower level language (usually machine language)

How does Java work
	1.) Write a program
	2.)Compile the program into Java bytecode (.class)
	3.)Run the program on a Java virtual machine

Why use Java
	Simple to learn, O.O.P., network savvy, robust, secure, portable.
	
Java class libraries
	The collection of preexisting Java code that provides solutions to common programming problems.

Basic Java program must have:
	1.) public class <name> {
		<method 1>
		<method 2>
		<method 3>
			.
			.
			.
	}

Method
	A program unit that represents a particular action or computation.

	public static void <name> {
		<statement 1>;
		<statement 2>;


****CLASS NAMES ARE UPPER CASE, AND METHOD NAMES ARE LOWERCASE. STATEMENTS END IN SEMICOLONS (;).
	static = method of the class
	void = doesn't return anything****

Statement
	An executable snippet of code that represents a complete command.
	
	System.out.println("Hello World");

String Literal
	Surrounding text in Quotation marks

	"Hello World"
	
	You must use double quotes
	
	'Bad Stuff here'

	Must not span more than one line

println();
	Each println statement produces a different line of output.

Escape sequences
	String literals can lead to difficult situations. What if you want to print a double quote (")?
	\t = tab space
	\n = new line
	\" = quotation mark
	\\ = backslash

print() vs println()
	print() = produces output on current line without going to a new line of output
		Ex. System.out.print("you are");
		    System.out.print("swag");
	println() = produces output and then moves onto next line.

Identifiers and Key Words
	Identifier
		A name given to an entity in a program such as a class, method, or variable.
	Classes - uppercase
	Methods - lowercase
	use cammel case - hi There; Trig Functions

	Identifiers must start with a letter which can be followed by any number of letters or digits
	Java also includes the underscore (_) and $ as letters.

	The following are legal identifiers:
		_count, $2donuts, MAX_COUNT

	The following are not legal identifiers:
		two+two, hi there, 2by4

	List of Java Reserved words see table 1.4 in your book in Chapter 1

Comments and Readability
	1) Put class and method headers on lines by themselves
	2) Put no more than one statement on each line
	3) Indent your program properly. When an opening brace ({) appears, increase the indentation of the lines that follow it.
	When a closing brace appears, reduce the indentation. Also, make sure to indent statements 
	inside curly braces by a consistent number of spaces. A common choice in the industry is 4 spaces, and I want you to use that in this class.
	4) Use blank lines to separate parts of the program.

Comments
	Text that programmers include in a program to explain their code. The compiler ignores comments.
	Two wasy to write comments in java.

	1) //This is
	   // a comment
	2)
	/* This is a comment */

****EVERY PROGRAM IN MY CLASS (FOR CREDIT) MUST START
/*
Shaan Mathur
Per. 4
Assignment # or the project name
*/

Every method needs a comment
(A short description of what the method does)

ie // returns the average of a group of numbers

Program Errors
	Syntax Errors - bad grammar that is caught by the compiler
	Logic Errors - when you write a program that doesn't perform the task that it was intended to perform
	Runtime Error - Logic errors that are so severe that Java stops your program (program crash) from executing

	Logic errors are also called "bugs"
	We use the term like "bug-ridden code" and "buggy" to describe poorly written programs.

	The procss of fixing those bugs is called "debugging".

Procedural decomposition (Redundancy)
	Solving problems by dividing the problem into manageable pieces.
	i.e. Dividing a large task into subtasks.

	Java is designed for objects, and programming in Java usually involves
	decomposing a problem into various objects, each with methods that 
	perform particular tasks.

	Methods help reduce redundancy.

Static Method
	A class method, not an object method, that contains Java statements.

Method Header
	public = indicates that this method is available to be used by all parts of your program
	static = means it's a class method, not an object method
	<name> = the name of the method
	void = means the method does not return a value
	Empty parantheses "()" = means you are not passing the method any paramaters
