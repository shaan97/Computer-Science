 Your assignment is to design a finite-state machine to control a simple vending
 machine.  The machine only takes nickels and dimes, dispenses gum which costs
 10 cents, and candy which costs 15 cents, and gives correct change.  The
 possible inputs to the machine are n (a nickel is inserted), d (a dime is
 inserted), g (gum is requested), and c (candy is requested).  The possible
 outputs of the machine are N (return a nickel), D (return a dime), G (dispense
 gum), and C (dispense candy).  Each of these inputs and outputs should be
 represented by a single wire from the outside of your controller.  Your machine
 must be able to correctly serve an arbitrary number of customers in sequence.
 Design your circuit with edge-triggered J-K flip-flops.  You must give a state
 diagram with the transitions labelled with inputs and outputs, a state table
 including the flip-flop inputs and all the outputs, Karnaugh maps for the
 outputs and flip-flop inputs that can't be simplified by inspection, the
 simplified logic equations, and the overall circuit diagram, including the
 generation of the clock signal.  Minimize the number of states needed.  Use the
 standard binary count sequence for your state assignment.
