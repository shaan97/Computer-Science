 Your assignment is to design a digital clock that displays seconds, minutes,
 and hours, in standard, i.e. non-military, time.  The input to your circuit
 will be a clock signal with a one-second cycle time (one rising edge every
 second), and the output will be six seven-segment displays.  You may use
 positive edge-triggered J-K flip-flops, and any circuits you have previously
 designed, or have been designed in class.  You should design any new circuits
 needed, showing all your work and circuit diagrams, and clearly show how the
 counters are cascaded together.  Your final solution should be a block diagram
 where the counters and decoders appear as boxes with all inputs, outputs, and
 connections clearly labelled.  Note that there is some subtlety involved in the
 hours display.  In particular, the count sequence must be correct, and a zero
 leading digit should not be displayed for the hours.  You must show that your
 circuit will not cycle through unused states indefinitely.  Be sure that the
 clock inputs to all flip-flops are clearly specified and indicated.
