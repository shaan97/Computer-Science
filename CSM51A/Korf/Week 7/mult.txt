 Design a sequential circuit to multiply two non-negative four-bit numbers
 represented in standard binary.  Your circuit will have two four-bit inputs, a
 single start input, a clock input, and an eight-bit output.  The start input
 will normally be zero, and will initiate the multiplication operation by a
 pulse to one.  You may assume that the start pulse is one clock wavelength
 wide.  Approximately four clock pulses later, the product of the two inputs
 should be available at the outputs, and remain available until the next
 multiplication operation is initiated.  You must show all data paths and
 control logic.  Use standard modules wherever possible and minimize the number
 of discrete gates. Give a detailed description of how your circuit works.
