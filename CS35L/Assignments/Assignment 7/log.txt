LABORATORY	SHAAN MATHUR UID: 904606576

In lab, we inserted the provided Ubuntu CD's to run a temporary version
of Ubuntu. Opening terminal, we want to check if openssh-server and
openssh-client are installed. To do this we run

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

This prints only

openssh-server		install

So we need to install the client as well, which we can do by running

sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Which successfully installs the client as well, which we verify
by rexecuting the dpkg command with aforementioned arguments and grep.

SERVER SIDE
First, I used my machine as the server. I execute

ssh-keygen

Which generates the public and private keys. I then created an account
for my lab partner on this server:

sudo useradd -d /home/lab7 -m shaan
sudo passwd 1234

This set up an account with username shaan and password 1234.
Following the optional part of the assignment, we disabled password-
based authentication by editing the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. It 
was not initially READ-WRITE (it was in fact READ-ONLY) so we had to
chmod the permissions.

chmod +w /etc/ssh/sshd_config
emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Where the file said "PasswordAuthentication: Yes", we changed it to
a No. Now the server was set up for a user to ssh in.


CLIENT SIDE
I used my machine as a client seeking to ssh into a server. I execute

ssh-keygen

Which once again generates the public and private keys. Next I needed
to log in with the account set up for me by my partner. I copied
first my public key to the server for the sake of key based
authentication. I needed to figure out the IP address to do this, which
we could find out by using the command

hostname -i

With that IP, I copied the public key to the server as mentioned.

ssh-copy-id -i shaan@164.67.100.233

Next I added the private key as well to the authentication agent.

ssh-add

Finally I was able to ssh into the server set up by my lab partner
by using the -X flag for X11 forwarding:

ssh -X shaan@164.67.100.233

I could then try running a command on the remote host to open an internet
browser like firefox by running just the command firefox:

firefox

And it opened on my computer.
