HOMEWORK

1. Despite the fact that the teams were observing the bytes go across
our network, it would still be secure. This is due to the fact that
the bytes themselves are encrypted. Since the other teams do not
have access to the private key (which is what can decrypt the data
in the first place), they cannot decrypt our message digest.

(1) In the case of knowing our keystrokes, the other teams could
be able to reproduce our user name and password, allowing them access
to our private key, thus compromising our encrypted bytes that they are
presumably observing.

(2) This would also be very insecure. The other teams would now have the
ability to access the private key, which is exactly what is preventing
our data from being decrypted in the first place.

2. gpg --verify functions to verify that the document has integrity
and is untampered. It does not try to figure out what its origin is. Thus
a malicious user could pretend to be someone else, use their own public key
with message digest algorithm to the receiver. The receiver would use
the public key owned by the malicious user to decrypt the digest and
compare with the document without encryption. The receiver will know
certainly that the message was sent without modification, but they would
not realize that the person who sent it was not who they believed it to
be. Thus a trustworthy third party (like a certificate authority) is 
necessary to verify the sender's identity based of the sender's issued
digital certificate.
