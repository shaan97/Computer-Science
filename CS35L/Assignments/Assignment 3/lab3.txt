I begin by grabbing the Coreutils 7.6 by copying the download link and
performing a wget on the SEASNET servers. Note that I am on lnxsrv07.

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

This extracts a new file into the current directory called core-utils-7.6 
within a few moments.

Next, we make a temporary directory under our home directory (~/) and call it
~/ coreutilsInstall.

cd ~
mkdir coreutilsInstall

Changing directories back into the core-utils-7.6 directory, I execute the 
following:

./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/shaan/coreutilsInstall/

This takes a minute to finish executing. Then I execute

make
make install

Now everything has been compiled and installed. Now changing directories into
the core-utils-7.6/src, we can execute:

./ls -l

Which generates the wrong format of the date, following the format of
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.

We then wish to generate a patch file:

emacs patch_file

We then copy paste Padraig Brady's workaround patch into this file using the
Emacs editor. To apply the patch, we note that we must get rid of the
"dummy" folder names in Brady's email (e.g. "a/src/ls.c", "b/src/ls.c"). To
perform this elegantly, we can use the -p[num] flag to get rid of leading
directory names (thus getting rid of the a/ and b/). The appropriate flag
would then be -p1.

patch -p1 < patch_file

After this, we cd up to the top level of the source tree and
once again execute

make

The output says that the only files regenerated were ls.l, dir, vdir, ls,
dir.l, vdir.l and ls.o were regenerated. These are all necessary files
(ls and dir are esentially the same. Testing ./dir -l and ./ls -l results
in the same output). Thus it makes sense that these files are all modified.

Changing directories into the coreutils-7.6/src, we execute

./ls -l

which does indeed output the correct date format of MONTH DAY YEAR or
MONTH DAY TIME, if the year is the current year. To test further, we create
two new files in the same directory, one with a date from Jan 1, 2000

touch z_test_file
touch -t 200001010342.42 z_test_file2
./ls -l

This outputs the corret output, with z_test_file in the MONTH DAY TIME format
and z_test_file2 in MONTH DAY YEAR format.

Redirecting into the coreutilsInstall/bin directory and using

./ls -l

Does put the wrong output with the wrong date format, as expected.
