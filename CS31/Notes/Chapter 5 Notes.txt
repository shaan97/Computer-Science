Arrays
	We typically encounter groups of like minded objects. Each object in the set is the same. This overall set has a size.


	Array Declaration
		Syntax
			type arrayname[ size ];
			
			Example
				int grades[5];
	
		Size needs to be a constant integer. Variables cannot determine size of array -- must be predetermined at compile time.

	Array Initialization
		If you only initialize some elements, the rest will be initialized to 0 (or their equivalent for that particular type).
		If you don't intiialize any element, garbage values will be there.

	Array As Function Parameters
		What is really passed? Think of array as three parts:
			1. Address of first element arrName[0]
			2. Array base type
			3. size of array

		Only first piece is passed!

	Typical Array Operations
		Searching and Sorting

		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		
		const int DECLARED_SIZE = 20;
		void fillArray(int a[]. int size, int& numberUsed);
		int search(const int a[], int numberUsed, int target);


Sorting
	Selection Sort
		Find smallest item and switch it with index 0.
		Recurse.
